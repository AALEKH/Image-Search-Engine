# Image-Search-Engine
Image Search Engine, based on Haar Cascade Classifier and CBIR  

Pre-requirements:
* OpenCV 

*Python 2.7

To Run:

* python main.py <name of image to identify>

* All credits to: https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2014/12/01/complete-guide-building-image-search-engine-python-opencv/ and help from various websites such as http://realpython.com and few others that I might have not mentioned when I binded together the script following various examples several years ago (please *please* mention as an Issue if there is something that catches your attention that should be in credits that I did not mention all those years ago). This I guess was kind of binding different script together (not sure what I was thinking) but credits for cars3.xml and other sources of script from which i  learned how to use opencv with python 2.7 is missing. Plus I should have forked the script  and not understand it line by line and then making something similar to the implementation. As of today I wasn't able to find source where I learned functioning of various script but I would be really grateful if the person reading this happen to find it, makes a PR for credit mentioning as it is going to be fair practise.
